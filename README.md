# Cloud Skills Roadmap 2026

A **month-by-month beginner guide** to go from zero to job-ready in cloud, DevOps, and hybrid infrastructure. Use this alongside hands-on practice and the linked resources.

---

## How to Use This Roadmap

- **Pace:** One folder = one month (or two, where marked). Work through them in order.
- **Hands-on:** Watch + read, then build. Use the linked tutorials, docs, and repos.
- **Portfolio:** Months 6–8 are project-focused—build and document them for your resume.
- **Interviews:** Months 9–12 focus on technical and behavioral interview prep.
